# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# coding_challenge-27 --- Sudoku Goku 

Oh boy this is going to be a good one! **In this month's coding challenge we are going to really push your boundaries when it comes to coding and logic**. As programmers there are times where we think a problem is too difficult to solve and we want to give up. However, those moments are opportunities that can have a real positive effect on your ability to improve and develop strong skills. This coding challenge aims to do exactly that: Help you push through some hard boundaries so that by the end of it you feel like a better programmer (and you will be!). 

You can work on a project individually or in a group and you can use the video below as a "guide" on how to solve this problem and also how Sudoku works. Please note that there are many solutions and you will be able to use Recursion or not to solve this problem (if you don't know what Recursion is, check out that section in my [Master the Coding Interview course](https://zerotomastery.io/promotions))

**What we are building:A Sudoku Solver so you can be Sudoku Goku -->** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM


Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work **or if you would like to look for people to work with on a project.** At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites/projects/code on here to showcase what the ZTM community has built. You can find past coding challenge submission [here](https://zerotomastery.io/community/coding-challenges/)

## What Am I  Building??
**You will try to build a program that is able to solve a Sudoku puzzle by itself!** You can use whatever programming language you want including Python and JavaScript. The problem is *NOT* as hard as you might think, but it will require you to really think about the program and design a working solution. 

To get an idea of what you are building, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM
